This is a simple single page javascript app that enables a user to do the following entirely on their own local computer/browser without sending any data to a server:
1. optionally upload an existing markdown version of their resume (.md file)
2. edit using a simple markdown editor in their browser. There are buttons for a few common types of markdown syntax, but the intent is to just use markdown to edit directly.
3. save a copy as markdown
4. export as pdf

The typical use case for this is managing multiple versions of a resume or similar document. I use it to export various markdown files to PDF such as meeting notes. The screenshot below shows what this looks like deployed on a web server. ChatGPT or similar tools can aid you in figuring out how to deploy this locally or onto a web server.
**This is not supported in any way and there may never be further updates**
