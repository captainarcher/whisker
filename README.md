This is a simple single page javascript app that enables a user to do the following:
1. optionally upload an existing markdown version of their resume (.md file). If you don't have one yet, that's okay and you can start from scratch. Unfamiliar with markdown? Consider this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
2. edit using a simple markdown editor in their browser. There are buttons for a few common types of markdown syntax, but the intent is to just use markdown to edit directly.
3. save a copy as markdown
4. export as pdf for submission

The typical use case for this is managing multiple versions of a resume or similar document. 

There is a hosted version on a GitHub page at: https://whisker.thomasu.me

You can also run this locally by downloading the files to your computer and then opening the index.html in a web browser. Alternatively, you can deploy this to your own web server.

Importantly, no data is collected. This is run locally in your browser, but I placed a copy of the index.html and other files on a GitHub page for convenience. 


**This is not supported in any way and there may never be further updates**
